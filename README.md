# math-quiz
I was showing my daughter, Julia, that you can create anything you want if you know how to code... We were talking about a simple 'math game', so I decided to spend a little over an hour (I know, but I'm brand new!) making this one.  P.S. I've made a few modifications since the first pass, so I've probably spent a few hours now.
